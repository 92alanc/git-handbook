        I don\'t track any of your or your device\'s data. The only tracking is done by Google
        to provide ads for the intent of monetising this app.
        The service that collects that information is Google Firebase. If one day any information
        beyond the one previously mentioned is collected, it\'s Google\'s responsibility, not mine.
